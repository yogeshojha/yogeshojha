### Hi there, I am Yogesh!

I am a Research Engineer at [TRG Research and Development](https://www.trgint.com/) and creator of reNgine. You can find most of my open-source contributions in [reNgine](https://github.com/yogeshojha/rengine).

When not infront of computers, I do Jiu-Jitsu and Mixed Martial Arts. 

I very often gaze stars, hoping to be interplanetary and optimistic about humanity's future among the stars.

I also believe that our curiosity will take us beyond this blue horizon, and we will carry our our stories of Human Endurance, Suffering, Resilience, Humanely Love, Ethics and most importantly human values to yet another planet. 

We must thrive to expand as far and wide as we possibly can to ensure that the fire of humanity can burn brighter eons, may human sacrifices never be forgetten as they fuel us to stars ✨

**Our Cosmic endowment awaits for us to share our stories.**
