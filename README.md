### Hi there, I am Yogesh!

I am a Research Engineer at [TRG Research and Development](https://www.trgint.com/) and the creator of reNgine. You can find most of my open-source contributions in [reNgine](https://github.com/yogeshojha/rengine).

I often do software, sometimes hardware, and a lot of security.

I am deeply passionate about running, when not in-front of computers, I am probably running or signing up for my next race ;p

I very often gaze at stars, hoping to be interplanetary and optimistic about humanity's future among the stars.

I also believe that our curiosity will take us beyond this blue horizon, and we will carry our stories of Human Endurance, Suffering, Resilience, humane love, Ethics, and most importantly human values to yet another planet. 

We must thrive to expand as far and wide as we possibly can to ensure that the fire of humanity can burn brighter eons, may human sacrifices never be forgotten as they fuel us to stars ✨

**Our Cosmic endowment awaits us to share our stories.**
