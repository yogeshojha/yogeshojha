### Hi there, I am Yogesh!

I am a Research Engineer at [TRG Research and Development](https://www.trgint.com/) and the creator of reNgine. You can find most of my open-source contributions in [reNgine](https://github.com/yogeshojha/rengine).

I often do software, sometimes hardware, and a lot of security.

When not in-front of computers, I am probably running or reading ;p

I very often gaze at stars, hoping to be interplanetary and optimistic about humanity's future among the stars.
